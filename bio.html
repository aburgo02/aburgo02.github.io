<h4>Biography</h4>

<p> I'm currently a senior at Tufts University. A little about me.
    I've lived in Massachusetts my whole life and I love playing soccer, 
    tennis, and visiting aquariums in my spare time. I'm passionate about 
    programming and ever since declaring it as my major sophomore year I can't
    get enough of it. Once I graduate I don't know what direction my skills 
    will take me and I am excited to find out!</p>
